### TODO

- [ ] finish naive single-core sampler
- [ ] autocorrelation functions
- [ ] design: keep C or change for C++17 or above?
- [ ] extract other data
- [ ] data handling
- [ ] make single-core swap sampler fast
- [ ] python bindings for single core
- [ ] openmp parallelization for swap sampler
- [ ] look at other sampler
- [ ] mpi parallelization for swap sampler
- [ ] hybrid samplers

- [ ] next step: integrate into rsmi pipeline
